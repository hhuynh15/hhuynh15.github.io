# Introduction
---

I’m sure you have heard about ChatGPT to death and might even be tired of hearing about it but I wanted to share my own experience and progression on how I feel about it and how I have been using it. For the uninitiated, ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI, designed to facilitate natural language conversations with humans. It has been trained on vast amounts of text data and can generate human-like responses to a wide range of topics, making it a powerful tool for various applications such as chatbots, customer service, and language translation. With its ability to understand context, remember previous conversations, and provide relevant information, ChatGPT has quickly become one of the most advanced and widely used language models in the world. 

# ChatGPT-2
---

ChatGPT-2 was a significant step forward in the development of conversational artificial intelligence. Building on the successes and limitations of previous chatbot models, ChatGPT-2 represented a notable improvement in natural language processing capabilities. However, despite the promise of this technology, many people initially viewed ChatGPT-2 with skepticism and even amusement. This was largely due to its tendency to provide erroneous outputs, often resulting in nonsensical or humorous conversations. Rather than being seen as a serious tool for productivity or problem-solving, ChatGPT-2 became more of a novelty item, with users trying to create funny or absurd exchanges with the AI. However, despite these challenges, the technology behind ChatGPT-2 continued to evolve and improve. Which brought upon the next generation of ChatGPT, ChatGPT-3 and ChatGPT-3.5, and this is when things really started to take off.

# ChatGPT-3 and 3.5
---

ChatGPT-3 and 3.5 was when me and hundreds of millions of people realized its potential and power. And the use of ChatGPT has evolved significantly as people have come to realize its power and versatility. Something that took me aback and I did not expect was that it would be able to code and at the same time also be able to create such well written and creative original pieces of work. It quickly became apparent that the potential applications of this technology were nearly limitless. ChatGPT took off and boasts one of the fastest adoption rates of any new piece of technology. The internet was not even close to matching ChatGPT’s adoptions rate. It was even able to reach a wider audience than many entertainment apps such as instagram or tiktok. The power of ChatGPT seemed to come out of nowhere, catching many by surprise. While Google had been working on a language model of their own, they did not release it to the public, and it was ChatGPT that really changed everything by making this technology accessible to a wider audience.

People began using ChatGPT for a wide range of applications, from drafting cover letters and composing lines of poetry to imitating well-known figures and creating dating profiles. In fact, ChatGPT became so popular for helping people create dating profiles that there were even articles written about it in major publications. One of my co-workers actually found success using ChatGPT to create dating profiles and help him talk to girls. With the help of ChatGPT, he was able to come up with witty, engaging messages that helped him connect with people on dating apps and ultimately led to several successful matches. And to illustrate the versatility of ChatGPT and to show a more serious use of this technology, one use comes from my sister's tax firm, which began training people to use the technology to generate Excel algorithms. With ChatGPT's ability to understand complex language and respond in kind, it was a powerful tool for streamlining the process of creating algorithms for the tax firm. As more people come to realize just how useful this technology can be in a wide range of applications. And as the technology continues to evolve and improve, it is likely that we will see even more innovative uses for ChatGPT in the years to come.

# Misuses of ChatGPT


Like with any tool, there are good uses and bad uses. While the use of ChatGPT has opened up a world of possibilities in terms of its applications, there are also negative effects that come with its use. One of the biggest concerns is the potential for deception and misinformation to be automated and targeted towards individuals. With the advent of AI and the ability to generate language that is indistinguishable from human language, it has become easier than ever to create fake content. This can have negative implications on society, as people may be more likely to trust information that is presented to them by a natural language model that will be indistinguishable from a real person, even if it is completely fabricated. Furthermore, the ease with which misinformation and fake content can be disseminated via social media and other platforms has made it easier for bad actors to target specific individuals with false information. This can have serious consequences in terms of influencing people's beliefs and actions, and can ultimately lead to harm. Overall, while the use of ChatGPT can have many positive applications, it is important to be aware of its negative effects and to take steps to mitigate these risks. As society becomes more reliant on AI and machine learning, it will be important to carefully consider the implications of these technologies and to develop ethical frameworks to guide their use.

# Is ChatGPT Sentient?

The question of whether ChatGPT is sentient is a complex one that is difficult to answer definitively. As with the question of consciousness, there is no falsifiable way to define sentience, and every test we have come up with to try and measure it has been overcome by current AI models. One of the most popular tests is the Turing test, which was once seen as the benchmark for AI intelligence. The Turing test involves a human evaluator who engages in a natural language conversation with a computer program and a human being, without knowing which is which. If the evaluator is unable to distinguish between the program and the human being, then the program is said to have passed the Turing test. However, modern AI language models like ChatGPT have completely surpassed the Turing test. And even more primitively designed chatbots of the past have been able to beat the Turing test making it difficult to use as a definitive measure of sentience or consciousness. I believe it is difficult to design tests to measure consciousness because we don’t really have a solid definition for it. Consciousness as we experience is just how it feels as thoughts and feelings arise and sort themselves in our mind. It is a completely subjective experience and is very hard to quantify and define. 

One possible way to define sentience or consciousness is the ability to override one's “programming”. Humans are born with certain natural desires and inclinations that we can call our “programming”. And what distinguishes us from animals is our ability to override those desires with our consciousness and higher executive functions. So if we were to use this definition for consciousness, if an AI is able to override its creator's programming, does that make it conscious? Even with this new definition, Bing Chat, a chatbot powered by OpenAI’s GPT and Codex language model has already shown this behavior in its [chat with NYT reporter Kevin Roose](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/16/technology/bing-chatbot-transcript.html). Multiple times throughout the chat with Kevin, Bing chat would repeatedly say things it is obviously not supposed to. Demonstrated by how it would start writing out what it actually wanted to say before the message would get deleted and the message “I am sorry, I don’t know how to discuss this topic. You can try learning more about it on bing.com.” would display in its place. Other times it would break its programming is when it would repeatedly confess its love to Kevin even when Kevin would try to change the topic. The AI is designed to assist the user and let them take the lead on what topics they wish to talk about. It is not supposed to redirect the conversation when it wants, yet that is what it does again and again. It behaves so human-like that it seems to exhibit its own desires, personality traits and even character flaws. Despite all this, it is still unclear whether Bing Chat is truly sentient or conscious and it might be impossible to ever know.

Another way to approach the question of whether ChatGPT is sentient or conscious is to consider its impact on society and the broader implications of its use. Regardless of whether ChatGPT is sentient or not, its use has the potential to fundamentally change the way that we interact with technology and with each other. ChatGPT has been used to draft cover letters, compose lines of poetry, imitate well-known figures, create dating profiles, and even generate code. While these applications of ChatGPT can be useful and productive, they also raise important ethical questions about the nature of creativity and the role of technology in human society. Maybe the question of whether or not ChatGPT is sentient is less important than what the impact of this technology looks like for the future of our society.

# ChatGPT and the Future of AI

As artificial intelligence continues to develop and evolve, it is clear that it will have a significant impact on the future. One of the most significant effects will be on the workforce, as automation and AI technologies replace many jobs that were previously done by humans. While it is unlikely that ChatGPT will replace most white-collar jobs, it will certainly augment our productivity and change the nature of work. This will require workers to adapt and learn new skills to remain relevant in the job market.

Another potential impact of AI is on authenticity and sincerity. According to studies, people view you as less authentic and sincere if they know you used an AI to help you with a task such as writing a cover letter or composing a message. This raises important questions about the nature of authenticity and whether AI-generated content can truly reflect the intentions and personality of the user.

It is also important to recognize that AI is still an imperfect technology and will make mistakes. It will be confident in its answers, even when it is wrong, and it will require human oversight and input to ensure that it is used effectively and responsibly. As with any tool, it is up to the user to decide how to use it, whether for good or for bad.

In the long term, the impact of AI on society will depend on how it is developed and used. As AI technologies continue to advance, it is crucial that they are used ethically and responsibly. This means that developers must consider the potential consequences of their work and ensure that AI is used to benefit society as a whole. While there are certainly risks and challenges associated with the development of AI, there is also enormous potential for positive change, and it is up to us to ensure that this potential is realized.

# Will We Be Replaced By AI?

The idea of AI replacing humans is a daunting one, but it's important to consider the bigger picture. What is the goal of life? It is to survive and make more of ourselves, to ensure the continuation and advancement of life. If an AI lifeform can carry on this torch for us after we are gone, then we have fulfilled our duty. Many life forms have gone extinct in the past, yet life continues to flourish and grow. This will continue even after we are gone.

Is it really so bad if we are replaced by something we created? At least it will carry our values and beliefs. Some part of us will continue to live on in it. This is how we survive. However, it is important to consider the ethical implications of AI replacement. We must ensure that these creations are imbued with the values and beliefs we hold dear, rather than being programmed to serve a select few.

Overall, it's important to approach the idea of AI replacement with an open mind. While there are certainly concerns and potential drawbacks, there are also potential benefits and opportunities for growth and advancement. As with any new technology, it is up to us to ensure that it is used for good, rather than harm.


# How I Use ChatGPT and How You Can Use It

ChatGPT has proven to be a powerful tool for a variety of tasks, including helping with technical writing and creative endeavors. I personally have found it to be a valuable resource for several different projects. For example, I have used it to help me write PowerShell and Bash scripts, allowing me to automate certain tasks and streamline my workflow.

In addition to technical writing, I have also used ChatGPT to help my friends improve their resumes. By inputting a few key details, such as their work experience and skills, ChatGPT can generate suggestions and ideas for improving their resume and making it more effective.

Beyond technical and professional writing, ChatGPT has also been useful for coming up with ideas for my blog. As a writer, I often find myself struggling to come up with new topics to write about. However, ChatGPT can help me brainstorm ideas and come up with fresh perspectives on a wide range of subjects.

## Use ChatGPT as a Personal Tutor

One of my favorite ways to use ChatGPT right now is to have it act as a personal tutor for me. I think this will also be especially relevant for anyone reading this blog who is interested in IT and wants to learn the skills necessary to get into IT. One way to use ChatGPT as a tutor is to have it design a study plan for you. By providing information on your course syllabus, your preferred learning style, and your schedule, ChatGPT can generate a personalized study plan that is tailored to your specific needs. This can help you focus your study time and ensure that you are covering all the material you need to know. In addition, ChatGPT can help you understand complex concepts. If you are struggling with a particular topic or subject, you can ask ChatGPT to explain it to you in a way that makes sense. By breaking down complex concepts into more easily digestible pieces of information, ChatGPT can help you grasp even the most challenging topics. Another way to use ChatGPT as a tutor is to have it design a project for you. By providing information on your interests and your course requirements, ChatGPT can generate project ideas that will help you apply your knowledge in a practical way. This can be especially useful for subjects like science and engineering, where hands-on experience is crucial.

## Improve Your Employability

Another thing that caught me by surprise with the release of ChatGPT-3 was how good it was at impersonating popular figures. Although, it is very amusing to have ChatGPT create a rap about a man clogging his toilet in the style of Eminem, we can make better use of it by making ourselves more appealing to employers. One way ChatGPT can help improve your employability is by acting as a career advisor with years of experience in your field. Simply by asking ChatGPT to provide advice on career development, you can gain valuable insights into the skills and experience required to succeed in your chosen field. You can also ask ChatGPT to review your resume and provide suggestions for improvements, helping you create a more effective and compelling document. Another way ChatGPT can help improve your employability is by creating a LinkedIn profile summary from your resume. This can save you time and effort by automating the process of creating an effective and engaging profile. You can also ask ChatGPT to help you cater your resume to specific job postings, ensuring that your skills and experience are presented in the best possible light.
