Today I officially signed on to be an AWS cloud apprentice at New Apprenticeship. Never would I have thought that I would be here 2 years ago let alone 6 years ago. 2 years ago I didn't even know that cloud engineering was a job I could do. I just stumbled my way into this job by following my passions. I learned Linux fundamentals basically on my own by spinning up a server at my workplace and hosting game servers off it. I learned docker because I wanted to expand to multiple servers while still controlling each server's resource utilization. Whenever there was something I wanted to achieve but didn't know how to do it, I would just acquire the skill on my own. I self taught myself Python because I wanted to make my own discord bot and Python was the most accessible one to me. I was so involved in Python development that I was asked to become an official plugin developer for an open source discord bot. However I had to turn down the position as I didn't feel like my skills were up to snuff compared to the other developers that were on the team. Looking back I should have taken it and used it as a learning opportunity but my self doubt and anxiety got the best of me, I won't let that happen again. Even now, I am diving head first into something completely new that I don't fully understand. I'm nervous as hell as to the things that might go wrong but whatever comes my way, I'm going to give it my all and try to overcome it. All these various skills that I have acquired over the years chasing my passion eventually lead me to the cloud. I don't meet many people who can genuinely say that they love what they do, so I feel lucky that I can do that.
